## Support code for birdsong and spike sorting pipeline based on spikeinterface for spikeglx and openephys
*Last updated October 30, 2024*

**Not** recommended for spike sorting and curation, as this pipeline relies on deprecated versions of public spike sorting software. Currently used for synching of neural and audio data, and detection/curation of bouts of song from raw audio.
